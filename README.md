# Gallery
The Gallery of Programming Projects I (Anthony Shih) feel comfortable sharing to others.\
These projects range from games to applications, and sometimes school projects.\
Unfortunately, most of the projects don't "look" really good due to my lack of artistic ability, so a majority of this is to showcase proof of concepts.

  1. Auto Chess Assist\
    Windows application I made to track item drops in a game called Dota Auto Chess.
  2. Idle Game Assist\
    Two applications made in Java:\
    a. An auto clicker that needed to click in multiple distinct locations in a specific order and do a certain action every X minutes.\
    b. Script that uses recursion to calculate optimal path for a daily resource.
  3. Jeopardy\
    Java GUI application that simulates a simpler version of 3 person Jeopardy, but with a pre-selected order of questions that can be customized for any subject.
